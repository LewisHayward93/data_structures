#+TITLE: Data Structures

This repository contains some leetcode/dynamic programming problem solutions.

Emphasis on the data structures used to solve solutions efficiently have been highlighted/

* Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

- simple problem on leetcode
- brute force solution to do for loop within a for loop to iterate through each element, $0(N^2)$ time complexity

I noticed that the brute force algorithm was fast enough for leetcode testing given the small input parameters, to help highlight the benefits of using a hashmap/dictionary, I have created a program to test against inputs of verying lengths.

** Results

| Number of integers | Without Map (ms) | With Map (ms) |
|--------------------+------------------+---------------|
|                100 |                0 |             0 |
|               1000 |                1 |             0 |
|              10000 |               15 |             1 |
|             100000 |              995 |            13 |
